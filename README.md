# Teaching

A modular website to centralize all my teaching resources (slides, attendance, other logistical information...)

### 61c (su23)

- much more minimal lol

### 61a (su22, fa22, sp23)
- generate attendance links with [suri](https://github.com/jstayton/suri)
- create slides with [marp](https://github.com/adit-bala/teaching-slides)
